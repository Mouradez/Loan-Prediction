The dataset contains the following features:
- **Loan_ID**: Unique identifier for each loan application.
- **Gender**: Gender of the applicant.
- **Married**: Marital status of the applicant.
- **Dependents**: Number of dependents.

- **Credit_History**: Credit history of the applicant.
- **Property_Area**: Location of the property.
- **Loan_Status**: Target variable indicating loan approval status.

- ## Expected Outcomes

- A high-performing machine learning model for loan approval prediction.
- A user-friendly Streamlit web application for bank employees to input customer data and receive predictions.
- Improved efficiency in the loan approval process.
- Insights into the key factors influencing loan approval decisions.

- ## Demo

Here is a small demo of the application:

The application has two pages. The first page, called 'Home,' contains the project description, data examples, and plots for data visualization. The second page is for predictions, where the user can input their information to receive a prediction from our model.
